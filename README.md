# OptimalPortfolioPython

This script is designed to grab data from Quandl for certain stocks and run a Monte Carlo simulation 
in order to find the optimal portfolio. The data then is plotted afterwards.
It is set up for four stocks, but can easily be modified for more or less.
 
Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pandas
- Scipy
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Quandl

To install the required packages on a mac, install pip first:
- sudo easy_install pip

Then install the packages this way:
- sudo pip3 install python3
- sudo pip3 install pandas
- etc

There may be some dependencies that you need to install to get all of these packages installed. Quandl no longer provides free data, so it is limited to March 2018
